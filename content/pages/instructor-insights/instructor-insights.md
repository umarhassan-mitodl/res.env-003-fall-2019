## Resource Overview

EarthDNA’s Climate 101 is a resource designed to provide volunteers with all the materials they need to plan and deliver interactive presentations to educate young people at universities, secondary schools, or other organizations about the urgency of climate change.

The creators of EarthDNA’s Climate 101, Brandon Leshchinskiy and Prof. Dava Newman, hope that the young people who attend these presentations will be motivated to speak with their family members and persuade them that immediate societal action is urgently needed if the earth is to remain habitable in coming years.
